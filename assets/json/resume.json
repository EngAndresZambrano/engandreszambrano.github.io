A solution is presented based on a local network comprising five WI-FI technology routers, with the measurement of their respective RSSI through Android devices. The solution is oriented towards indoor location. Additionally, a virtual machine is implemented to act as the server for processing information. Within the server processing stage, a neural network implemented using Tensor Flow in Python is hosted. This neural network is responsible for generating location predictions and facilitating interconnection with other processing stages of the system. The presented system's functionalities include patient registration through interaction with an Android application that communicates with the server. Various processing stages are carried out through PHP files, which handle requests to the MongoDB-implemented database. The system encompasses automatic detection and identification of patients upon their arrival at the clinic, prediction, and automatic recording of their movements, alongside the calculation of durations in each clinic area until their departure. Recorded data can be visualized through a Power BI-implemented dashboard.","highlights":["Digital Detection","Indoor Location","Digital Identification","Neural Network","Router","Wi-Fi","Virtual Machine","Tensor Flow","PHP","Python","Apache","Android App","Kotlin","RSSI"],"startDate":"2022-12","endDate":"2023-12","url":"https://red.uao.edu.co/entities/publication/1d6591cc-af84-4a0f-b7d9-d2cdd97d50d4"}]}

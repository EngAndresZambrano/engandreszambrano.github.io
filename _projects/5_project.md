title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack Simulation and Defense Strategies
description: This project focuses on simulating a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack within a network environment. It includes the execution of ARP spoofing to intercept traffic between a victim and a gateway, followed by methods to protect Windows and Linux systems from such attacks.

The project aims to simulate and analyze a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on a network to demonstrate its impact and potential security threats. The simulation involves the use of ARP spoofing to manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables and redirect traffic from the victim machine to the attacker's machine. The attack begins with network configurations, followed by the installation of tools such as "dsniff" and "arpspoof" for traffic interception. Once the attack is initiated, network traffic is captured, including sensitive data like login credentials, using tools like Wireshark.

In addition to demonstrating the attack, the project also explores mitigation strategies, such as configuring static ARP entries and implementing network monitoring tools to detect and prevent ARP spoofing. These defense measures are tested on both Windows and Linux machines. The project provides valuable insights into how these attacks work, their potential consequences, and effective countermeasures to protect networked systems from such vulnerabilities.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}

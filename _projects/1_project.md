This project involves an in-depth analysis and presentation of key information security standards and frameworks that are commonly applied within business environments to ensure effective cybersecurity practices and risk management. It provides a structured overview of international and national models that support organizations in developing, maintaining, and continuously improving their security strategies.

Among the frameworks and standards explored are:

COBIT, focused on IT governance and management;

The ISO/IEC 27000 series, including ISO 27001 (Information Security Management Systems), ISO 27002 (Security Controls), ISO 27005 (Risk Management), ISO 27032 (Cybersecurity), and ISO 27035 (Incident Response);

ISO 31000, which provides general principles for risk management;

The NIST SP 800 series and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for security controls and risk mitigation strategies;

OWASP and OWISAM, offering methodologies and best practices for web application security and secure administration;

The Modelo de Seguridad y Privacidad de la Información (MSPI), a comprehensive model focused on integrating privacy and security principles into organizational information management;

National cybersecurity references such as INCIBE (Spain’s National Cybersecurity Institute) and CN-CERT (China’s National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team).

The project emphasizes the practical application of these standards, comparing their objectives, scope, and implementation benefits. It serves as a resource for professionals seeking to align their organizations with industry best practices, reduce cyber risk exposure, and establish a resilient security posture rooted in globally recognized frameworks.

    These visual summaries provide a comparative look at three of the most widely adopted cybersecurity frameworks: NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), COBIT, and the Center for Internet       Security Critical Security Controls (CIS CSC). Each of them offers unique strengths and areas of focus that support organizations in shaping their cybersecurity strategies.

    NIST CSF emphasizes five core functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—designed to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. It is highly adaptable and suitable for            organizations of all sizes and sectors.

    COBIT focuses on governance and management of enterprise IT. It ensures that IT is aligned with business goals while maintaining compliance, risk management, and performance                measurement.

    CIS CSC offers a prioritized set of actions that provide specific and actionable ways to stop the most pervasive and dangerous attacks. Its control-based approach is especially             effective for technical teams looking to implement practical security measures quickly.

    By understanding the core characteristics of each framework, organizations can better evaluate which model—or combination of models—best suits their operational context, compliance         requirements, and risk profile.

 <strong>Key Characteristics of International Standards and Guidelines</strong>

In this section, we explore the key characteristics of internationally recognized standards that serve as the foundation for robust information security management across organizations. These standards—particularly those in the ISO/IEC 27000 series—establish best practices for risk management, cybersecurity governance, incident response, and operational resilience. Each framework addresses a specific aspect of information security, offering guidance that is both adaptable and scalable for businesses of all sizes.

By understanding the distinct purpose and focus of standards such as ISO 27001, 27002, 27005, 27032, 27035, and ISO 31000, professionals can effectively align organizational practices with global expectations, enhance their security posture, and build a culture of continuous improvement in cybersecurity and risk management.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}

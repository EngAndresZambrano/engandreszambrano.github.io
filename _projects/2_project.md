This project provides a step-by-step guide to deploying a fully functional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Elastic SIEM. Built in a virtualized environment, the setup includes a Kali Linux host running the Elastic Stack and multiple Windows clients acting as data sources through installed agents.

The guide covers technical requirements, the installation of Elastic components, and the integration of system and network logs. Special emphasis is placed on the use of Kibana to configure interactive dashboards for visualizing log data, monitoring system behavior, and detecting anomalies in real time.

Designed for academic use and hands-on learning, this lab provides a realistic approach to understanding how Elastic SIEM supports centralized log management, threat detection, and incident response. The implementation also explores the benefits and challenges of deploying such a system in a secure, isolated virtual environment, as demonstrated in the video below.

The video demonstrates the use of Elastic SIEM and Kibana for real-time security monitoring and incident response. Key features include:

<strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong> Elastic SIEM enables the tracking of security events as they occur, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities such as unauthorized port scans and pings.

<strong>Alert Generation:</strong> The system automatically triggers alerts for suspicious activities and sends notifications via email, facilitating quick incident response.

<strong>Interactive Dashboards:</strong> Elastic SIEM offers dashboards that visualize security statistics and trends, assisting teams in detecting patterns and suspicious behavior.

<strong>Active Prevention:</strong> Beyond monitoring, the system can block unauthorized actions and generate detailed incident reports, enhancing threat response capabilities.

<strong>Log Integration and Analysis:</strong> The system integrates logs from various machines, allowing for comprehensive security analysis and threat detection.

These features make Elastic SIEM a powerful tool for managing and responding to security threats efficiently.

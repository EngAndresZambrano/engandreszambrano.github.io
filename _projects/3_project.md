This project presents a complete black box vulnerability assessment conducted on a virtual machine, simulating a real-world offensive security audit. The audit was performed using Kali Linux and a range of industry-standard tools, including Metasploit, Nmap, Gobuster, Nessus, and others.

The findings were compiled into a professional audit report using PwnDoc:

    </a>
  </div>
  
Which ensures a structured format with key sections such as execution timeline, executive summary, vulnerability overview, and detailed technical analysis.

The report covers several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, including:

 <strong>CVE-2023-26048 (Jetty DDoS vulnerability)</strong>

 <strong>CVE-2024-23897 (Arbitrary file read in Jenkins)</strong>

 <strong>CVE-2024-40725 (Source code disclosure)</strong>

 <strong>Privilege escalation via GNU Screen 4.5.0</strong>

 <strong>Weak/default credentials and web-based injection attempts</strong>

The following images display the key findings from the activity. Using the John the Ripper tool, a hash found in the passwd file was successfully cracked for the user 'kali'. With these credentials, privilege escalation was achieved through the execution of a setuid binary, utilizing Radare2 for analysis and exploitation.
